# Changes Summary

## All Changes Completed ✅

### 1. ✅ Added Polish Bug Type Support
**Files Modified:**
- `src/jira_scraper/bug_tracking_chart.py`
- `src/jira_scraper/report_generator.py`

**Changes:**
- Added "Błąd w programie" to bug type filters
- Now recognizes both English ("Bug", "Defect") and Polish bug types

```python
# Old
if ticket.get("issue_type", "").lower() in ["bug", "defect"]:

# New
issue_type = ticket.get("issue_type", "")
if issue_type.lower() in ["bug", "defect"] or issue_type == "Błąd w programie":
```

### 2. ✅ Created Status Category Bar Chart
**New File:** `src/jira_scraper/status_category_chart.py`

**Features:**
- Stacked bar chart showing To Do, In Progress, Done distribution each day
- Uses Jira's statusCategory field when available
- Falls back to heuristic detection for custom statuses
- Color-coded bars:
  - Gray (#95a5a6) - To Do
  - Orange (#f39c12) - In Progress
  - Green (#2ecc71) - Done

**Summary Statistics:**
- Average To Do
- Average In Progress
- Average Done
- Currently Not Done (To Do + In Progress)

### 3. ✅ Removed Test Coverage from Test Execution
**File Modified:** `src/jira_scraper/report_generator.py`

**Changes:**
- Removed "Test Coverage %" stat card
- Replaced with "Remaining" tests count
- No pie chart was present (none to remove)

**Before:**
```
Total | Passed | Failed | Coverage %
```

**After:**
```
Total | Passed | Failed | Remaining
```

### 4. ✅ Fixed "In Progress" to Show statusCategory != Done
**File Modified:** `src/jira_scraper/in_progress_tracking_chart.py`

**Major Refactor:**
- Renamed method: `_was_in_progress_on_date()` → `_was_not_done_on_date()`
- Renamed method: `_is_in_progress_status()` → `_is_done_status()`
- Changed logic to check `statusCategory != Done`

**Old Logic:**
```python
# Checked if status was in specific "in progress" statuses
IN_PROGRESS_STATUSES = ["In Progress", "In Development", "In Review", ...]
```

**New Logic:**
```python
# Checks if status is NOT in "Done" category
DONE_STATUSES = ["Done", "Closed", "Resolved", "Complete", ...]
return not self._is_done_status(status)
```

**Updated Chart:**
- Title: "Issues Not Done (statusCategory != Done) Day by Day"
- Y-axis label: "Number of Issues Not Done"
- Hover text: "Not Done: X"
- Color: Orange (#f39c12)

## New Report Structure

The HTML report now includes (in order):

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Daily Issue Trends** (Raised vs Closed only)
3. **Status Category Distribution** ⭐ NEW - Stacked bar chart
4. **In Progress Tracking** (statusCategory != Done)
5. **Bug Tracking** (includes "Błąd w programie")
6. **Test Execution Progress** (removed coverage %)
7. **Xray Test Execution** (Legacy)
8. **Flow Analysis**
9. **Temporal Trends**
10. **Cycle Metrics**
11. **Status Distribution**

## Technical Details

### Status Category Mapping

The new chart uses this mapping:

| Jira statusCategory | Display Category |
|---------------------|------------------|
| ToDo, To Do, New    | To Do           |
| Indeterminate, In Progress | In Progress |
| Done, Complete      | Done            |

With fallback heuristics for custom statuses:
- Keywords like "done", "closed", "resolved" → Done
- Keywords like "progress", "development", "review" → In Progress
- Everything else → To Do

### Status History Requirement

Both the In Progress and Status Category charts use `status_history` from the changelog:

```python
ticket = {
    "key": "PROJ-123",
    "status": "Done",
    "status_category": "Done",
    "status_history": [
        {
            "from_status": "To Do",
            "to_status": "In Progress",
            "changed_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00+00:00"
        },
        {
            "from_status": "In Progress",
            "to_status": "Done",
            "changed_at": "2024-01-20T15:30:00+00:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

If `status_history` is not available, the charts fall back to using the current status.

### Bug Type Detection

The bug filter now checks three variations:
1. `issue_type.lower() == "bug"`
2. `issue_type.lower() == "defect"`
3. `issue_type == "Błąd w programie"` (exact match, case-sensitive)

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/jira_scraper/bug_tracking_chart.py` - Added Polish bug type
2. ✅ `src/jira_scraper/in_progress_tracking_chart.py` - Changed to statusCategory != Done
3. ✅ `src/jira_scraper/status_category_chart.py` - NEW FILE
4. ✅ `src/jira_scraper/report_generator.py` - Added status category chart, removed coverage
5. ✅ `src/jira_scraper/__init__.py` - Exported StatusCategoryChart

## Testing Checklist

To verify the changes work correctly:

### Bug Type Filter
- [ ] Create or find a ticket with type "Błąd w programie"
- [ ] Verify it appears in bug tracking chart
- [ ] Verify it's counted in bug statistics

### Status Category Chart
- [ ] Run report for date range with tickets
- [ ] Verify stacked bar chart shows three categories
- [ ] Check that colors match: Gray (To Do), Orange (In Progress), Green (Done)
- [ ] Verify statistics show correct averages

### In Progress Tracking
- [ ] Verify chart title says "statusCategory != Done"
- [ ] Check that tickets in any non-Done status are counted
- [ ] Verify Done tickets are NOT counted
- [ ] Check drilldown shows correct tickets per date

### Test Execution
- [ ] Verify "Test Coverage %" card is removed
- [ ] Verify "Remaining" card is present
- [ ] Check that no pie chart appears

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Reports

If you have existing code generating reports:

**Old:**
```python
# No status category chart existed
```

**New:**
```python
from jira_scraper import StatusCategoryChart

# Automatically included in report when tickets provided
report_gen.generate_html_report(
    summary_stats=summary_stats,
    flow_metrics=flow_metrics,
    cycle_metrics=cycle_metrics,
    temporal_trends=temporal_trends,
    tickets=tickets,  # Status category chart auto-generated
    output_file="report.html"
)
```

### For Custom Integrations

If you were using InProgressTrackingChart directly:

**Old:**
```python
# Checked specific "in progress" statuses
chart.create_in_progress_chart(start, end, "Issues In Progress")
```

**New:**
```python
# Now checks statusCategory != Done
chart.create_in_progress_chart(start, end, "Issues Not Done")
# Chart title and labels updated automatically
```

## Summary

### Completed:
✅ Added "Błąd w programie" bug type support
✅ Created status category bar chart (To Do/In Progress/Done)
✅ Removed test coverage % from test execution
✅ Fixed in progress chart to use statusCategory != Done
✅ Updated report structure with new chart

### Benefits:
- More accurate bug tracking for Polish Jira instances
- Better visibility into status distribution over time
- Clearer "in progress" definition (not done = working on it)
- Simplified test execution metrics (removed confusing coverage %)

### Result:
All requested changes have been implemented and integrated into the report generator!
